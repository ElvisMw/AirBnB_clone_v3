# 0x05. AirBnB Clone - RESTful API

## Overview
This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School and is to be completed by a team of two people: Jamesmax Munene and Mwanthi Waita. The project, initiated by Guillaume, the CTO at Holberton School, aims to develop a RESTful API for an AirBnB clone using Python and Flask.

### Project Schedule:
- **Start Date:** February 22, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** February 27, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** February 23, 2024, 12:00 PM

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, team members are expected to demonstrate understanding in the following concepts:
- REST API
- AirBnB clone
- Flask and its features
- HTTP methods for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting resources
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- Designing modular applications with Flask Blueprints
- Writing Flask tests
- Understanding of PEP 8 style guide

### Concepts to Explore
Before diving into the project, it is recommended to review the following concepts:
- [REST API concept page](#)
