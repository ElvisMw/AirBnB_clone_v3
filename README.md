# Understanding APIs and REST

## What REST Means

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful systems typically use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, and they communicate over the Internet using standard protocols.

## What API Means

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

## What CORS Means

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls access to resources from different origins (domains). CORS allows servers to specify which origins are allowed to access their resources, helping to prevent cross-origin attacks.

## Types of APIs

There are several types of APIs, including:
- **Web APIs**: APIs exposed over the web using HTTP protocols.
- **Library APIs**: APIs provided by libraries or frameworks to interact with their functionality.
- **Operating System APIs**: APIs provided by operating systems for interacting with system resources.
- **Hardware APIs**: APIs provided by hardware devices for controlling and accessing hardware features.

## What Is an API?

An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

## What Is a REST API?

A REST API is a type of web API that follows the principles of RESTful architecture. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, and they communicate over the Internet using standard protocols.

## HTTP Methods for CRUD Operations

- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST**: Create new data on the server.
- **PUT**: Update existing data on the server.
- **DELETE**: Delete data from the server.

## How to Request a REST API

To request a REST API, you typically use an HTTP client library or tool (such as cURL) to send HTTP requests to the API endpoint. You specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and provide any necessary parameters or data in the request body or URL. The API server processes the request and returns a response, usually in JSON or XML format.
